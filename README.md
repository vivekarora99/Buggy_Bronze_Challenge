What is Bronze Challenge?
In this challenge, group of student wok on single buggy. The buggy will follow pre defined track twice in clockwise direction, under full supervisory control. Full supervisory control means students need to control movement of buggy through wireless communication. It can detect an obstacle using ultrasonic sensor and will be able to parks safely. During the movement, it will be able to prints state of the track and buggy at each gantry stop. Figure show the track and buggy movement during bronze challenge.
